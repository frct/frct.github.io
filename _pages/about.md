Hello! I'm François, an Anglo-French (or Franco-English, pick your poison) computational biologist. My work mostly deals with modelling animal behaviour, in particular learning and decision-making, but also haemostasis (blood clotting) and the philosophy of biology. The purpose of this website is to talk about my research, explain how to use some of the tools I've learnt, and discuss ideas that have inspired me.
