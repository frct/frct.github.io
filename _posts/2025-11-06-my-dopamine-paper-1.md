I cannot think of a better paper to inaugurate this series of spotlights on my research career than my 2019 paper on dopamine and the control of exploration. To take a slightly crude analogy, if my papers were my children, this paper would be the archetypal prodigal son: the first born, most eagerly awaited for, but also the most painful to birth, the one with the most regrets perhaps, but also the one with the greatest outcome. A glorious failure if you will.
